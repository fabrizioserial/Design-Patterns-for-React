This project shows how can we apply Design Patterns to React. All of them has a Readme file where you can find the 
description of the pattern and the disadvantage of use it!

## What is a Design Pattern?

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of 
the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever 
doing it the same way twice. The pattern has four essentials elements:

### Name

It's a way that we have to describe the pattern, the problem, the solution and his consequences when we talk with
colleagues, documentation and even to ourselves.

### Problem

Describe the problem and its context. Sometimes will include a list of conditions that must be met before it makes
sense to apply the pattern

### Solution

Describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. The solution does not
describe a particular implementation, because this provides a template with an abstract description of how can we use some
elements to solve the problem.

### Consequences

Are the results and trade-oggs of applying the pattern. They are critical for evaluating design alternatives and for understanding
the costs and benefits of applying the pattern
